# Cross platform gaiacli binaries

Courtesy of [ValidatorüåêNetwork](https://validator.network).

This repository contains _unofficial_ gaiacli binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX ("Darwin").

They are built using the official [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) source code and provided here as a convenience for users unable to compile it.

Please note that the binaries are provided without any warranties and have not been thoroughly tested. Use at your own risk.

Known issues:
* gaiacli-win defaults to store user settings in the root of the drive. Provide a proper `--home` directory.
* No Ledger support right now.
